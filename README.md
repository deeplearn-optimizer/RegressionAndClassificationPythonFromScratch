# RegressionAndClassificationPythonFromScratch.

Here, I am gonna show how to implement Regression and Classification on a complex datasets provided by IIIT Bangalore as part or our curriculum,I have ended up being 1st in both the competitions hosted on kaggle by our institute.

# Information about data provided.

The Weather.csv contains the weather information that will be used as our regression dataset.
The Transfusion.csv contains blood donation related data of thousands of donors and our task is to gain some inference from that data and predict wether the donor donated blood on a particular date or not.

# Python Notebooks.

Both Regression and Classification Files contains code to train linear models from sratch using just numpy and no other libraries were used.

# Thank You!
